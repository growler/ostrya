# Ostrya -- Design Decisions

This document records the design decisions of the port and the alternatives
that were rejected, with the reason for each. The on-disk format is in
`format-reference.md`. The observed behavior of the `ostree` command is in
`conformance/cli-behavior.md`, and each difference from it is in
`conformance/cli-surface.md`. The rustdoc of each crate documents the API.

## Dependency policy

The port is pure Rust. The Rust crate ecosystem is in scope, and C libraries
are excluded. `CLAUDE.md`, "Goals", states the two exceptions: `liblzma` for
xz, and PCRE2 in the `ostrya-cli` binary alone. Each is built from source and
linked statically under its feature, and needs no C runtime beyond the libc
that `std` links.

These C libraries are excluded, with the Rust path that replaces each:

- `openssl-sys` -- TLS through `rustls` with the `rustls-graviola` provider,
  and ECDSA through `p256`.
- `libgpg-error` and `gpgme` -- GPG signing through the system `gpg` binary,
  and GPG verification through the `pgp` crate.
- `libcurl` and `libsoup` -- HTTP through `hyper`.
- `libarchive` -- tar through `smol-tar`.
- `libcomposefs` -- composefs images through `ostrya-composefs`.
- `glib` -- GVariant through `ostrya-gvariant`, and the key file through
  `ostrya-core`.

Two CI steps in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` hold the rules over the whole
graph. One step holds the permissive-license rule. The other step fails on a
package that declares a `links` key and is not on its allowlist. The comments
of the two steps state their rules.

## Foundation crates

The workspace crates take these external crates directly. `CLAUDE.md` has an
"Authorized" section for each crate it marks so, with the terms of its
feature set and its graph.

- `rustix` -- the syscalls that a portable async file API cannot express:
  fd-relative open, stat, link, rename, readlink and mkdir, xattrs, statx,
  statvfs, FICLONE, O_TMPFILE with linkat, record locks, and fsync and
  syncfs.
- `smol` -- the default runtime backend, in `ostrya-rt` alone.
- `tokio` -- the optional runtime backend, in `ostrya-rt` alone.
- `futures-io` and `futures-lite` -- the async traits and the combinators
  that the library is written against.
- `pin-project-lite` -- pin projection for the stream wrapper types.
- `sha2` -- SHA-256, for object checksums and for fs-verity digests.
- `miniz_oxide` -- the raw DEFLATE encoder of archive-mode content objects.
  `ostrya-core` takes it directly, so the stored `.filez` bytes for a given
  `[archive] zlib-level` are the same under each feature set. The golden
  SHA-256 vectors in `crates/ostrya-core/src/deflate.rs`, one for each level
  from 1 to 9, fail the test suite if a new version writes other bytes.
- `async-compression` -- streaming DEFLATE inflate of archive-mode content
  objects, and streaming xz of static-delta parts.
- `liblzma` -- the xz codec behind `async-compression`.
- `bsdiff` -- bspatch stream generation for static deltas. It has no
  dependencies and no `unsafe`. The port reads the streams with its own
  bspatch.
- `smol-tar` -- async tar import and export.
- `ed25519-dalek` -- the ed25519 sign engine, in `ostrya-sign`.
- `p256` -- the spki sign engine, in `ostrya-sign`.
- `pgp` -- OpenPGP keyring parsing and signature verification.
- `hyper` -- the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 engine of `ostrya-fetch` and
  `ostrya-server`. Both crates take version 1.11.1 or later. Version 1.11.0
  can keep the last chunk of a response body in its write buffer when the
  first poll of the body is pending, and then the response does not end.
- `rustls`, `rustls-graviola`, `futures-rustls`, `rustls-native-certs` and
  `rustls-pemfile` -- TLS. See "TLS stack".
- `url` and `pkcs8` -- in `ostrya-fetch`.
- `getrandom` and `x509-cert` -- in `ostrya-server`.
- `thiserror` -- the error types.
- `libc` -- in `ostrya-sys`, `ostrya-remote` and `ostrya-sign`.
- `clap` -- command-line parsing, in `ostrya-cli` and `ostrya-mountd`.
- `pcre2` -- the `commit --tar-pathname-filter` expression, in `ostrya-cli`
  alone. See "The expression engine of `--tar-pathname-filter`".
- `indicatif` -- the progress bar of `push` and `push-tree`, in `ostrya-cli`.

## The repository lock

The lock on `<repo>/.lock` is a classic `fcntl` record lock (`F_SETLK`,
through `rustix::fs::fcntl_lock`). An OFD lock was rejected: `rustix` does
not expose the OFD commands, and a raw OFD call needs the `libc` crate and
`unsafe` code.

A record lock and an OFD lock share one lock space. Thus the port and the
`ostree` command exclude each other on the same repository. This was
verified in both directions: each side held its lock while the other side
tried to get the lock.

A record lock belongs to the process, and the kernel releases it when the
process closes any descriptor of the file. Thus a process-global registry,
keyed by the `(device, inode)` of the lock file, keeps one descriptor and one
reference count for each repository. `crates/ostrya/src/lock.rs` documents
the registry.

## The GVariant codec

`ostrya-gvariant` is a GVariant codec written in the tree for the fixed type
set of ostree. No crate was taken, because the port needs byte-exact normal
form and decode with no heap allocation on the read paths.

Each object type has a hand-written codec impl. A proc-macro derive was
rejected. The set of object types is small and fixed, and a derive adds a
proc-macro crate together with `syn`, `quote` and `proc-macro2`. A derive
needs a dependency proposal under the confirmation rule of `CLAUDE.md`.

## The composefs writer

`ostrya-composefs` writes the composefs EROFS image. It is written in the
tree because no crate writes byte-exact composefs images under the no-C
rule. These crates were examined and rejected:

- `erofs/erofs-rs` and `Dreamacro/erofs-rs` read EROFS images and do not
  write them. Neither knows composefs.
- `composefs` (`containers/composefs-rs`, MIT OR Apache-2.0) writes images
  that are byte-identical to `mkcomposefs`. It has a non-optional `zstd`,
  which links C through `zstd-sys`, and a full `tokio`. No feature turns
  either off.
- `am-fs-erofs` writes generic EROFS images. It has no overlay xattrs and no
  fs-verity, and its byte layout is different from composefs.
- `lamfold-erofs`, `gobblytes-erofs`, `liberofs`, `erofs` and `nydus-rs`
  read images only, are stubs, or are container-image stacks.

`ostrya-composefs` writes only the metadata subset that composefs uses, and
no EROFS compression.

The fs-verity digest is a SHA-256 Merkle calculation over `sha2`. The
`fs-verity` crate was rejected because it takes `libc` with no condition.

The XATTR_FILTER field hashes each xattr name with xxHash32. The xxHash32 in
`crates/ostrya-composefs/src/xxhash.rs` is written in the tree to add no
crate. The golden filter bytes verify it.

## The spki sign engine

The spki engine is pure Rust over `p256`: deterministic ECDSA on NIST P-256
with SHA-256. The `ostree` command builds this engine only with OpenSSL.
The engine is behind the `sign-spki` feature, so a build without it has no
ECDSA crate tree.

No available build of the `ostree` command has spki. The maintainer decided
to cross-check the engine against the `openssl` command in both directions.
`format-reference.md`, "Signing details", marks the spki facts as a design
target. The test `spki_tool_cross_verify_pending` skips until a build of the
`ostree` command with spki is available.

## GPG

Signing runs the system `gpg` binary as a subprocess over its `--status-fd`
interface. Thus keys in an agent and keys on a hardware token work through
`gpg` with no code of their own, and the private key stays with `gpg`.

Verification is in the process, over the `pgp` crate. `sequoia-openpgp` was
rejected for its LGPL license. The port owns the trust policy: issuer
resolution, subkey bindings, expiry, revocation, the signature class and the
digest policy. No fallback to the `gpgv` binary exists, so one engine and one
policy give each verdict.

## TLS stack

The fetcher uses `rustls` 0.23 with `rustls-graviola` 0.4 as the crypto
provider. The provider is Rust together with formally verified assembly from
s2n-bignum, so the build needs no C compiler and no `cc` build dependency.
The provider supports x86_64 and aarch64 alone. A build for another target
needs a different provider in `crates/ostrya-fetch/src/tls.rs`.

`rustls-native-certs` reads the trust store of the host. `webpki-roots` was
rejected: its license, CDLA-Permissive-2.0, is not on the permissive list.

`h2` puts `tokio` and `tokio-util` into the graph under the `smol` backend
too. The fetcher uses only their I/O traits and codec framing, and drives no
tokio runtime.

## The HTTP adapters

The adapters between `hyper` and `futures-io` keep `forbid(unsafe_code)`.
They fill the read cursor of `hyper` through its safe `put_slice`. This
costs one copy for each read, because a read into the uninitialized buffer
needs `unsafe` code.

The request body is a `Body` type of the fetcher, so `http-body-util` is not
a dependency. The `basic` authorization header is encoded by
`ostrya-core::base64`, so no base64 crate is a dependency.

## The pull scheduler

`crates/ostrya/src/pull/drive.rs` is a poll core of the port.
`FuturesUnordered` was rejected: `futures-lite` has no unordered join, and
`futures-util` is not in the graph.

## The expression engine of `--tar-pathname-filter`

`commit --tar-pathname-filter` compiles its expression with PCRE2, the
library that the `ostree` command compiles it with. This follows rule 2 of
`CLAUDE.md`, "CLI compatibility is functional, not literal". Two other
engines were rejected on measurements:

- A backtracking matcher written in the tree. A review found three
  constructs that it read differently from PCRE, and three paths with no
  bound on the work.
- The `regex` crate. It read the POSIX class names as ASCII, and `$` as the
  end of the text. Thus one command line wrote two different commits.

## `#[non_exhaustive]` on the public types

The attribute marks a type that a caller matches over and does not build,
when the port owns its set of members and expects the set to grow.

- `ostrya::Error` has the attribute. Its variants are the error vocabulary of
  the port, and a new failure mode adds a variant.
- `TrustRoots` has the attribute. The port owns the set of trust settings.
- No option struct of the `ostrya` crate has the attribute: `PruneOptions`,
  `PullOptions`, `TarExportOptions`, `TarImportOptions` and the others. The
  attribute stops a struct expression outside the defining crate,
  `..Default::default()` included. Thus a new field in one of these option
  structs is a breaking change, and it takes a minor version before 1.0.
- `ostrya_server::ServeOptions` and `ostrya_mount::MountOptions` have the
  attribute. A caller starts from `Default::default()` and sets the fields.
- `ostrya_gvariant::Type` and `ostrya_gvariant::Value` do not have the
  attribute. The GVariant serialization specification closes the type
  alphabet, and the two enums name all of it. An exhaustive `match` over
  either enum is the gate that makes each site answer for a new type
  character. A new variant in either enum takes a major version.
